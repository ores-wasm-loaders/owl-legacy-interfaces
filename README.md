# owl-interfaces

The loader fleet's shared contract: the release manifest and loader-lifecycle vocabulary, declared as independent typespec and json schema authorities under `contracts/`.

Part of [`ores-wasm-loaders`](https://github.com/ores-wasm-loaders) — the org that owns the fleet's shared
web-loading layer for the 35+ marketing sites and their applications. Its sibling
[`ores-wasm-loaders-test`](https://github.com/ores-wasm-loaders-test) carries the external-facing test surface.

## What this org is for

Marketing sites are HTML-first and cheap. The applications behind them are not: a Flutter
web release or a Leptos/Dioxus island bundle costs a download, a compile and an
initialization before it is useful. This org shares the *loading and integration
infrastructure* across every product — one coordinator, one Flutter adapter, one Rust
adapter family, one manifest contract — so the expensive part is prepared while the visitor
is still reading, and so 80–90% of that plumbing is written once rather than 35 times.

It deliberately does **not** claim to share application bytes, application memory, or a
running runtime across a normal navigation. See `owl-docs/docs/architecture.md`.

## Conventions for this repository

- `contracts/typespec/main.tsp` and `contracts/json-schema/contract.schema.json` are independent, human-authored peers; `ores-contracts check` must find them equivalent before anything is generated. Neither is derived from the other.
- `contracts/manifest/` is the on-the-wire artifact contract (`owl-manifest.json`) that every app publishes and every loader reads; `tools/validate-manifest.mjs` is the dependency-free validator the other repos and CI use.
- Shape only. Scheduling policy lives in `owl-coordinator`; framework lifecycle lives in the adapters.

## Tests

```sh
node --test test/*.test.mjs
```

No third-party dependencies: the whole org builds and tests offline, because it has to run
in every product org's CI before anything else is installed.
